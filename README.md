1- rope.py 

This little  Py Cli creates a directory on your Desktop, and once you put in it different files, with different extensions,
it arranges them in folders where the names are the extension of your files. I hated to look over files with random names all over my Desktop, so I thought I might do something about it while The punisher S1 is downloading..

Usage is simple, just run "python ./rope.py" and follow instructions. 
-On first run : A folder is created on your Desktop, where you have to manually put all the files you have.
-With the folder /elegantor full of all your files, now you can elegant it, or delete its content.

Edit- Tried it on my new computer, and it didn't work. I don't even want to check why, because it looks horrible already.
